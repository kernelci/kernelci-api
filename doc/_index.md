This section covers the new KernelCI API as well as the initial pipeline using
it.

Their respective GitHub repositories are
[`kernelci-api`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-api.git) and
[`kernelci-pipeline`](https://github.com/kernelci/kernelci-pipeline.git).

An instance has been set up on `staging.kernelci.org`.  The Docker logs are
available in real-time via a [web
interface](https://staging.kernelci.org:9088/) for both the API and the
pipeline.  It also provides some [interactive API
documentation](https://staging.kernelci.org:9000/docs).
